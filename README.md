# Playlist Preserver

## Description

This little application was born out of the idea that I might one day lose all my music collection if, for some reason, Spotify went under. Or there backups did not get everything. So this application will allow you to backup your playlists.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Flask, Loguru
- **APIs**: Spotify API

## Planned Features

- **Automatic Backups**: Periodic backups set to the time you want.
- **Automatic Upload of Backups**: Automatically upload your playlists to some cloud hosting.
- **Different Formats**: For now the output will be the what the Spotify API outputs.

## Getting Started

_This section will be updated with installation, configuration, and usage instructions as the project develops._
